# Characterize Your Project!

> Want to give your project a cool name? A name with symbolic and profound meaning? You are in the right place!

Characterize is a database containing names that have symbolic meaning. It includes characters in history, books, legends and movies.

Search by character's name or by "qualities" (e.g. Wisdom) here: https://stanley0010.github.io/characterize/

## Motivation

As a developer, I have a lot side project ideas. And I always want cool names for them that mean something (not "Bronze Husky" from random project name generator). But something like Oracle(Matrix), a symbol of wisdom, and Gandalf(LOTR), the symbol of goodness. 

## Make it great together

I am no expert in history and neither do I know a lot of characters in movies and stories. But I believe many of you reading this are:) Please contribute! 

### Contribute to the database

This part requires the most contribution from you guys:)

#### Characters

Add characters that have a symbolic meaning or represents certain values. For example, good, evil, wisdom, ignorance, love and hatred. 

#### Description

Make it neat and easy to read. Do not include any jargons so that everyone can understand without context.

#### Where can I add my characters?

In the project directory under "src", you will find "data.json". It contains all characters' information. Take reference to the existing records' format or else the website will not work.

### Contribute as a developer

This is a React.js project, with the aim of not using too many packages to keep a small bundle size. 
This is also my first open-source project, so you can tell me how/ make it more open-source friendly.
Feel free to open an issue request to add additional features.

After each modification to the code, please deploy it and check if the website rendered properly.

`yarn start` to run your project locally.

`yarn test` to run test (contribution needed for testing the website).

`yarn deploy` to build the project for deployment and deploy it to Github Pages.
